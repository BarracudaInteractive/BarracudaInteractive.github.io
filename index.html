        <p class="center s24px">Hello there, we're Barracuda Interactive, a small Spanish videogame studio. We're not so big, but we're full of energy and enthusiasm to give players new and original ideas or, at the very least, something different from the standard.</p>

          <p class="center s24px">Our studio is made up of 6 members. All of us are quite versatile, since we don't specialize in a specific job. We have a main role, but we're also working in various areas.</p>

          <h3 class="center s36px">Adrian Rubio</h3>
          <a>
            <p class="left s24px thin">Adrian is our Social Media Manager, as well as Financial Director, and the Marketing's Big Boss. When it comes to development, he's happy to help with Sound Design, 3D Modeling and Programming tasks. Besides, he's also the Scrum Master (he's Atlas supporting the world).</p>

            <img src="PNG/Alejandro.png">
            <p class="right s24px thin">Main programmer, with extensive knowledge of Unity and working together with Álvaro, Alejandro is also a fundamental piece in both the Marketing section and the Production Team.</p>

          <h3 class="center s36px">Alvaro Martín</h3>
          <a>
            <p class="left s24px thin">Álvaro is the second half of the Programming Team. He also specializes in World Building (although the game doesn't need it). Furthermore, he's the main editor of this portfolio :)</p>

            <p class="right s24px thin">It seems Daniel's strong point is not Coding (who can blame him), so he dedicates his efforts to both 3D Modeling and Level Design.</p>

          <a>
            <p class="left s24px thin">Eric, apart from everything that is going to be said about him, is the Master Mind behind our current project. He had the idea and has thought out most of the mechanics. Therefore, he's responsible for the Production of the game.</p>

            <img src="PNG/Sergio.png">
            <p class="right s24px thin">Last but not least, Sergio is another one who does not want to get close to Unity or Visual Studio, so he dedicates himself 100% to the creative part, being responsible for the Visual and Sound Design, in addition to being a 3D Modeler.</p>

        <h1 class="center s48px">Rally Team Tactics (RTT)</h1>
        <p class="center s24px">Our first (and only, for now) project, Rally Team Tactics, which we will call RTT from now on.</p>
        <p class="center s24px">This game combines racing games with puzzles, not belonging to both genres 100%. In this game you play a former rally driver who, unfortunately, had a fatal accident. He managed to survive, but lost both legs. Now unable to drive again, they must train the new generation of rally drivers.</p>
        <p class="center s24px">In gameplay it will consist of giving instructions to the new drivers so that they complete the circuits in the most efficient way possible, without spending a lot of gasoline, and without exploding the car if possible.
