				<h1 class="center s48px">Rally Team Tactics (RTT)</h1>
				<p class="center s24px">Our first game has finally crossed the finish line!
						RTT represents our initial venture into the industry, and we poured our utmost effort and passion into its creation.
						If you're curious to learn more about the game, allow us to provide you with a glimpse of the underlying concept:</p>
				<p class="center s24px">RTT deviates from the conventional racing game format. In this unique experience, you assume the role of a former pilot who, unfortunately, 
						lost his right leg in a rally race accident. Unable to participate in races any longer, he chooses to become a mentor for aspiring rally racers.</p>
				<p class="center s24px">Rather than directly controlling the vehicle, your responsibility lies in analyzing the track 
						and offering instructions as a co-pilot. In this turn-based racing game, trial and error play a crucial role, as discovering the optimal strategy may require several attempts. 
						Balancing the vehicle on the road while monitoring damage and fuel levels may seem challenging, but RTT provides players with the necessary guidance to comprehend the systems 
						and ultimately master them, aiming to achieve the best times on the leaderboards.</p>
				<p class="center s24px">Eager to know more?
						Curious for more details? Stay tuned to our social media channels for updates on the game's post-launch content and community support!</p>
